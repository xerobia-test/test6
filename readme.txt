what you want to do is to

enter this command: git commit -a -m "MESSAGE" (saves it into local repo)

then this one: git push (pushes it into github/gitlab)

ok, so it seems that each online repo must only match one offline one.
also, time to make an CLI init and CLI gitall things to save time
also each folder defaults to no remote. add it via this cmd: git remote add origin https://github.com/xerobia-test/test3.git
